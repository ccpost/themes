# Warp Themes
This is a repository with themes for [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/).

## 1. How do I use a custom theme in Warp?
To start, create a config directory in your home directory:
```
mkdir -p ~/.warp/themes
```
Note that it may take several minutes for Warp to initially discover the new config directory.
You can either wait, or just restart the application.
After that step, all future changes to `~/.warp/themes` directory will be reflected in Warp within seconds.

Add your new custom theme yaml theme file to this directory:
```
cp ~/Downloads/my_awesome_theme.yaml ~/.warp/themes
```
Open the Settings menu (top right corner or `⌘-,`), and choose Select Theme. Your new theme should now be visible on the list of available themes. Click & confirm, and you're set!


## 2. How do I use this repo?
This repository is a collection of themes that you can use right away in Warp. 
It's split into two parts:
- [base16 themes](./base16/README.md)
- [standard themes](./standard/README.md)

You can select themes from either of those locations, depending on your preferences.
You can find previews of each of the available themes in the README of each directory.

The main difference between "standard" and "base16" themes is that "standard" themes follow the typical color setup, while "base16" themes follow the framework suggested by [@chriskempson](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16).
Some of the standard themes have their "base16" version available in the repo as well.

To install a theme from this repo you can:
- download just a single file and follow the steps from (1)
- clone the entire repo and run `mv <your_clone_location>standard/* ~/.warp/themes && mv <your_clone_location>base16/* ~/.warp/themes` to use all of the available themes

## 3. How do I write my own custom theme?
A custom theme in Warp has the following yml structure:

```
# Accent color for UI elements
accent: '#268bd2'
# Terminal background color
background: '#002b36'
# Whether the theme is lighter or darker.
details: darker
# The foreground color.
foreground: '#839496'
# Ansi escape colors.
terminal_colors:
  bright:
    black: '#002b36'
    blue: '#839496'
    cyan: '#93a1a1'
    green: '#586e75'
    magenta: '#6c71c4'
    red: '#cb4b16'
    white: '#fdf6e3'
    yellow: '#657b83'
  normal:
    black: '#073642'
    blue: '#268bd2'
    cyan: '#2aa198'
    green: '#859900'
    magenta: '#d33682'
    red: '#dc322f'
    white: '#eee8d5'
    yellow: '#b58900'
```

Each color is represented in hex and must start with with '#'.

`background`, `foreground`, `accent` and `details` are Warp-specific. 
The accent color is the one used for highlights in Warp's UI, while `details` describe what detailing options in our UI should we pick for the given theme. Options are `darker` (typically used for dark themes) or `lighter` (typically used for light-mode themes). 
`terminal_theme` represents the collection of normal & bright colors (16 total) known from other terminal themes (ansi colors).

## 6. FAQ

### Themes are cool, but will I be able to do more?
Yes! We've already shared some more mocks with our community on Discord showcasing background images, gradients and other options for themes.
Stay tuned, as we continue iterating on those!

### Is this a final format for the configuration?
The format itself will expand (background images, gradients) but we don't forsee any breaking changes to current themes. We also plan on supporting sharing/creating custom themes directly within Warp.
